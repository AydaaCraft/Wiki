# History

The server began in Late 2019 on version 1.14 and started out with a few basic plugins 3 different worlds, including Overworld, Realm and Skylands. Soon the server received numerous features and updates including Skyblock, a centralised Spawnworld, Playershops and Hall of Fame. The server also updated from 1.14 to 1.15 and to 1.16, but when it came to update to 1.17, it was decided by the community to refresh the server worlds and inventory to start anew.

Since 1.17 the server has gone through an overhaul bringing new exciting features alongside the old features it already had including...

* New Overworld world
* Custom Tiered Mobs
* Custom Weapons (3d Textures)
* Dungeons and Lairs
* New customised Realm world generation (Coming soon0
* Added new biomes and villages into Skylands world generation (Coming soon)
