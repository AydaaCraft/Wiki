# Soulbound

All items that drop from an Elite are soulbound to a player, If you attack and kill an Elite with another player, loot will drop for both players. Only you can pick up your own loot soulbound to you. This is a system in place to prevent players stealing good loot drops and giving you the crap loot, making the drops fair for everyone.

Soulbound items cannot be sold in the [Auction House](../../survival/auction-house.md), but other items like [Elite enchantment books](enchantment-books.md) and [charms ](charms.md)can.

Items can be unbound by using an "Unbinding scroll", This scroll can only be obtained by completing the Lv 200 The binder of worlds.
