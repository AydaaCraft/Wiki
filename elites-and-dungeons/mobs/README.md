# Mobs

Elites are special mobs that are enhanced with [special powers](elite-powers.md) and are designed to be stronger than vanilla mobs, Defeating these mobs can drop gear [**soulbound** ](../elite-items/soulbound.md)**to you**, making it so no other player can pick up your loot.\


Elites can be easily identified by an [attack level](../elite-items/attack-level.md) and mob name above their heads. Elites can spawn anytime and anywhere in the world and can be any vanilla mob, and their levels are based on your current [attack level](../elite-items/attack-level.md).



The higher your level, the higher the Elites strength and power will be. Once you reach a certain level Elites will begin to spawn with special powers \[[see here](elite-powers.md)], these include things like arrow resistance, arrow rain, freeze beams and more.
