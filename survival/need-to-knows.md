To get started in survival first you'll spawn in the Spawn Village, there is a collection of shops (or npc's) that can assist you along the way. A map will be provided below

### Surviving mobs and gaining armor

When you first kill a mob and start to equip armor, You'll be introduced to mobs with names above their heads with a number, These are [Elites ](../elites-and-dungeons/mobs/)and they come with their own dedicated section detailing stuff [here](../elites-and-dungeons/mobs/).\
