Step 2: Discovering the economy

Once the player has gotten the information about selling items, they'll naturally be drawn to sell it. If the world is set up, they will then find the Adventurer's Guild NPCs (details for world download and setup and in the spigot resource post).

They will find out that Elites use its own currency, which is necessary for balance reasons. They will also find out that they can unlock guild tiers, and will later discover that this is required if they wish to progress beyond level 10 elite mobs, as they won't get loot beyond tier 10 without unlocking more ranks. They will also be able to find out about the quest system, and start fulfilling quests to get extra currency, which will naturally lead them to seek opponents they would otherwise avoid. They may also find the Combat Instructor NPC, which will give them tips about the combat system. Globally, all NPCs give players important advice as they simply chat with them.
