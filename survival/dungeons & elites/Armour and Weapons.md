Soulbound items
All items that drop are soulbound to the player that earned them, these items cannot be picked up by other players.



Unbinding Items

If you have an item called "unbind scroll", you are able to use the Unbinder NPC to combine 1 scroll with 1 item in order to unbind it.

Note: The scroll will drop from the Ender Dragon fight which is a hard dungeon.

The scroll can only be used once. Once unbound, items can be sold or given to other players, or be used after a prestige.

Scrapping Items

Elite Items can be scrapped at the Scrapper NPC. There is a 50% chance that items will get scrapped correctly. Scrap is the basis for the rest of the Item System.

Upgrading Scrap

Elite Scrap can be upgraded at the Refiner NPC at a rate of 10 scrap of the same level for 1 scrap of a higher level.

Repairing Elite Items

Elite Items can be repaired at the Repairman NPC for scrap. The amount repaired is equal to the level and amount of Elite Scrap.

This means that a level 1 elite scrap will repair 1 durability, and that 2 level 50 scrap will repair a total of 100 durability.

Elite Item Upgrade Orbs

Elite Item Upgrade Orbs can be crafted at the Smelter at a rate of 25 scrap of a level for 1 item upgrade orb of the same level.

Upgrading Elite Items

Elite Items can be upgrade at the Enhancer NPC using 1 Item Upgrade Orb of a higher level than the level of the item. Items will always be upgraded by one level as long as the Elite Item Upgrade Orb is of a higher level than the Elite Item.

This means that a level 50 Elite Item Upgrade Orb will upgrade a level 49 Elite Item into a level 50 Elite Item, but it will also only upgrade a level 1 Elite Item into a level 2 Elite Item.
