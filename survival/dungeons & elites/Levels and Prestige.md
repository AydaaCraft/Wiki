Step 3: Progression

Now that the players have an idea of what's ahead of them, they will fight against increasingly stronger Elite Mobs as they progress through item tiers. By the time they reach diamond tier, they will find themselves capped by their guild tier, which should encourage them to unlock further tiers. Additionally, they will encounter random events which should increase their interest in the various mechanics that the plugin has to offer, especially when it comes to custom enchantments such as the flamethrower.

Step 4: High Tiers

Once the player has progressed up to around item tier 80 (or guild tier 8), they will start maxing out the difficulty of EliteMobs (for now). High level combat requires quite a lot more strategy, planning and combat execution than lower levels, as mobs have up to 7 different powers by that stage. They will be able to tell which loot they want to keep and which they want to discard, and will have a good idea of which are their favorite custom items. I highly recommend you make a lot of custom items as these are currently the main focus of mid to top tier players of EliteMobs.
