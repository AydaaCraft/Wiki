Step 3: Progression

Now that the players have an idea of what's ahead of them, they will fight against increasingly stronger Elite Mobs as they progress through item tiers. By the time they reach diamond tier, they will find themselves capped by their guild tier, which should encourage them to unlock further tiers. Additionally, they will encounter random events which should increase their interest in the various mechanics that the plugin has to offer, especially when it comes to custom enchantments such as the flamethrower.

Step 4: High Tiers

Once the player has progressed up to around item tier 80 (or guild tier 8), they will start maxing out the difficulty of EliteMobs (for now). High level combat requires quite a lot more strategy, planning and combat execution than lower levels, as mobs have up to 7 different powers by that stage. They will be able to tell which loot they want to keep and which they want to discard, and will have a good idea of which are their favorite custom items. I highly recommend you make a lot of custom items as these are currently the main focus of mid to top tier players of EliteMobs.




What is the Prestige System?

The Prestige System rewards players for resetting their EliteMobs rank, items and currency (in short, all of their progression) for two benefits: big fixed bonuses and showing off.

It is possible, and encouraged, to put the ranks of players as prefixes on chat through the use of Placeholder API in combination with any chat plugin which is compatible with Placeholder API.

One of the purposes of this is to allow players to clearly distinguish themselves as having not only beaten all of the EliteMobs progression, but have potentially done so several times, establishing their status as a very cool elite gamer.

What is the cost of the Prestige System?

Everything. At least, everything related to EliteMobs. The player's current guild rank will be reset to 1, the currency will be wiped and all the items will lose their binding to the player, meaning that when the player tries to equip it it will drop and they will be unable to pick it back up.

This is quite funny to see happen all at once when a fully equipped player activates the prestige while having all gear equipped, making it look like they're being born again.

What are the big fixed bonuses of the Prestige System?

Activating the prestige system will unlock the following in differing amounts, based on prestige level and guild rank level:

Maximum health (starting from prestige 1)
Chance to crit (starting from prestige 2)
Chance to dodge (starting from prestige 3)
Additionally, players will gain more money per kill for each prestige tier they increase, but rank costs will also go up proportionately. This is to reward players for upgrading, but also to lower the incentive that a player might have to try to farm at a really high level and then find a way to use that money to speed through the ranks of the next prestige run.

A fully upgraded player can experience 120 max health (compared to the vanilla 20), 10% base chance to dodge, 10% base chance to crit and 15x currency multiplier. This assumes a default setup. It's also important to note that this is for the maximum rank of Prestige 10 rank 20, which takes dedicated players years to obtain. Most people will stop playing Minecraft before grinding enough to reach this level.
