Step 3: Progression

Now that the players have an idea of what's ahead of them, they will fight against increasingly stronger Elite Mobs as they progress through item tiers. By the time they reach diamond tier, they will find themselves capped by their guild tier, which should encourage them to unlock further tiers. Additionally, they will encounter random events which should increase their interest in the various mechanics that the plugin has to offer, especially when it comes to custom enchantments such as the flamethrower.

Step 4: High Tiers

Once the player has progressed up to around item tier 80 (or guild tier 8), they will start maxing out the difficulty of EliteMobs (for now). High level combat requires quite a lot more strategy, planning and combat execution than lower levels, as mobs have up to 7 different powers by that stage. They will be able to tell which loot they want to keep and which they want to discard, and will have a good idea of which are their favorite custom items. I highly recommend you make a lot of custom items as these are currently the main focus of mid to top tier players of EliteMobs.



Guild tier 1 (starting default): up to tier 10 items, level 10 mobs

Guild tier 2: up to tier 20 items, level 20 mobs

Guild tier 3: up to tier 30 items, level 30 mobs

Guild tier 4: up to tier 40 items, level 40 mobs

Guild tier 5: up to tier 50 items, level 50 mobs

Guild tier 6: up to tier 60 items, level 60 mobs

Guild tier 7: up to tier 70 items, level 70 mobs

Guild tier 8: up to tier 80 items, level 80 mobs

Guild tier 9: up to tier 90 items, level 90 mobs

Guild tier 10: up to tier 100 items, level 100 mobs

From point on, prestige levels are required in order to unlock the guild tiers.

Prestige 1 Guild tier 11: up to tier 110 items, level 110 mobs

Prestige 2 Guild tier 12: up to tier 120 items, level 120 mobs

Prestige 3 Guild tier 13: up to tier 130 items, level 130 mobs

Prestige 4 Guild tier 14: up to tier 140 items, level 140 mobs

Prestige 5 Guild tier 15: up to tier 150 items, level 150 mobs

Prestige 6 Guild tier 16: up to tier 160 items, level 160 mobs

Prestige 7 Guild tier 17: up to tier 170 items, level 170 mobs

Prestige 8 Guild tier 18: up to tier 180 items, level 180 mobs

Prestige 9 Guild tier 19: up to tier 180 items, level 190 mobs

Prestige 10 Guild tier 20: up to tier 200 items, level 200 mobs






What is the Prestige System?

The Prestige System rewards players for resetting their EliteMobs rank, items and currency (in short, all of their progression) for two benefits: big fixed bonuses and showing off.

It is possible, and encouraged, to put the ranks of players as prefixes on chat through the use of Placeholder API in combination with any chat plugin which is compatible with Placeholder API.

One of the purposes of this is to allow players to clearly distinguish themselves as having not only beaten all of the EliteMobs progression, but have potentially done so several times, establishing their status as a very cool elite gamer.

What is the cost of the Prestige System?

Everything. At least, everything related to EliteMobs. The player's current guild rank will be reset to 1, the currency will be wiped and all the items will lose their binding to the player, meaning that when the player tries to equip it it will drop and they will be unable to pick it back up.

This is quite funny to see happen all at once when a fully equipped player activates the prestige while having all gear equipped, making it look like they're being born again.

What are the big fixed bonuses of the Prestige System?

Activating the prestige system will unlock the following in differing amounts, based on prestige level and guild rank level:

Maximum health (starting from prestige 1)
Chance to crit (starting from prestige 2)
Chance to dodge (starting from prestige 3)
Additionally, players will gain more money per kill for each prestige tier they increase, but rank costs will also go up proportionately. This is to reward players for upgrading, but also to lower the incentive that a player might have to try to farm at a really high level and then find a way to use that money to speed through the ranks of the next prestige run.

A fully upgraded player can experience 120 max health (compared to the vanilla 20), 10% base chance to dodge, 10% base chance to crit and 15x currency multiplier. This assumes a default setup. It's also important to note that this is for the maximum rank of Prestige 10 rank 20, which takes dedicated players years to obtain. Most people will stop playing Minecraft before grinding enough to reach this level.
