Step 1: Player's first encounter

A player in your server will acquire armor during normal gameplay. Once they have anything at iron level or better, they will start facing Elite Mobs which spawn naturally around them based on the armor the players are wearing. These Elite Mobs (when their level is high enough and the antiexploit system isn't triggered) can drop three types of loot:

Procedurally generated loot (the most common kind)
Custom loot (somewhat rare)
Elite Coins
(Note: You can read more about Elite Mob spawning and rewards here)
