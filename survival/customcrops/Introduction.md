Game Mechanics

Crops will start growing at about 7am (Game Time).
Crops in watered pot would definitely grow a stage every day while those in dry pot have less chance.

Season & Greenhouse

Season is now an important part of StardewValley Farming System. Crops only grow in a suitable season and inproper seasons will make crops into a dead stage. You can use greenhouse glass to allow them to grow all year.
