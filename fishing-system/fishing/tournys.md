To partake in a Tourny, you must first catch a fish around the dock area and you will be shown a timer for how long the Tourny will last.

Each Tourny will have a different objective, ranging from Shortest fish to Most fish etc..



Rewards will be given to 1st, 2nd & 3rd place with a small bonus for players participating thereafter.
