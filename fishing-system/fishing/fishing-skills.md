# Fishing Skills

Skills are divided into two groups.

1. Upgradable skills
2. One Time purchase skills

Upgradable skills cost Skill points to upgrade and gain diminishing returns with the more points you put into them

One time purchase skills cost a set amount of Skill Points but are unlocked forever. These skills level up based on your total Fishing level.



Upgradable Skills

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Better Gutting" %}
This skill give you more Entropy from Gutting Fish

Note: This skill does not stack with [Precision Cutting](../augments.md#precision-cutting-augment) and is calculated independently.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Luck of the Catch" %}
This skill give you more Entropy from catching fish.

Note: This bonus is calculated independently from other sources that give bonus entropy from catching fish.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Master Augmenter" %}
This skill reduces the cost to craft Fishing Augments.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Totem Leader" %}
This skill reduces your Totem cooldown when catching a fish

Note: This skill doesn not stack with augments that give you bonus fish, _eg._ [_Hot Spot_](../augments.md#hot-spot-augment)
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

One time Purchases (Costs 15 Skill points each)

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Divine Judgement" %}
This Skill gives a chance to summon a divine strike that causes a **Tsunami.** Fishing in a tsunami doubles all fish caught within its radius.

Note: Multiple Tsunamis from the same player cannot co-exist. Other players can benefit from your tsunami. [**Hot Spot**](../augments.md#hot-spot-augment) and similar effects do not stack with this.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Tribal Shout" %}
This skill gives nearby players inside of your **Fishing Totem** a percentage of the total effects.\








Note: This skill and totem effects cannot stack or overlap. Your own totem will take president over others. (If you are inside your own and another players). The owner does NOT lose the original buff.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Combo Catcher" %}
This skill increases a combo that increases your chance to catch rarer fish. Higher the skill level, the higher the combo can get.

Note: The maximum combo scales with the level. Every **20 catches** is roughly equal to **10** levels of [**Master Fisherman Augment**](../augments.md#master-fisherman-augment)**.**

Not catching a fish for **30 seconds** resets your combo. The **Current Combo stat** will update so you can track your current combo.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Augment Infusion" %}
This skill has a chance to refund some of the items used in augment crafting

Note: The percentage is calculated **individually** from each item used in the recipe. _(_[_See Augments)_](../augments.md)_._

_Eg._ 5% refund would have a 5% chance per item used. If an item is refunded, 50% of the material used is refunded regardless of chance.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
