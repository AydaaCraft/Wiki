# Fishing

To get starting with the expanded fishing system, all you need is a Fishing Rod of any kind (Yes there is more than one type) and just cast your rod out to the water.

You will either catch a default vanilla fish or a custom one, If you are lucky to catch a custom fish, its name will be displayed in chat and telling you to checkout **/fish menu** .

The fishing menu will be your go-to menu for all things.&#x20;

For an added shortcut you can crouch and right click your fishing rod to open the menu!

## Fish Tier ranking

All custom fish belong to tiers, Bronze being lowest and Mythical highest
