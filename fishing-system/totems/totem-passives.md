# Totem Passives

Totem passives are beacon-like powers that can be activated via the totem interface. These passives are only active when the item is not in cooldown.&#x20;

Also breaking the bottom observer in totem pole will save your current passives and cooldown and drop an item so that it can easily be built in another location.

There are several features of Fishing totems and many upgrades possible too.



## Totem upgrades

### Totem radius:

By default, Totem radius' are set at 5 blocks around it,\
Fishing within the radius will grant the active effects.\
Max level: 5

### Active time:

By default, The active time is set at 5 minutes.\
This upgrades has the ability to extend the active time of effects, before the totem goes into cooldown.\
Max level: 20

### Cooldown reduction:

By default, Cool down is set at 1 hour after being active with the above upgrade time.\
Upgrading this will grant shorter cooldown times allowing you to use the totem passives sooner.

### Passive slots:

Passive slots are essentially like totem skill points, These are used for requirements set by the passive. Upgrading to more slots will enable you to enable multiple passives at the same time or allocate all slots to one passive.
