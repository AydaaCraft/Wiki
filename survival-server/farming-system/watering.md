## Sprinklers & Watering Cans

A Watering-can also has its max storage and effective range. currently set to 1x3 or 3x3 for a golden watering can.

Right clicking with the sprinkler with a water bucket or watering can will fill it up. When right clicking the sprinkler, a hologram would be displayed showing level.
