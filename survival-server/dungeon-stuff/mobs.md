# Mobs

## When does an Elites spawn?

When a normal mob spawns near a player wearing armor. Only armor of at least tier 1 will cause Elite Mobs to show up. Higher tier armors spawn higher level mobs. They spawn based on a percentage chance, which is configurable in the MobCombatSettings.yml file.

If the player gear is not good enough, no Elite Mobs will spawn. If you are just roaming the wilds with no equipment on, you will not find any Elite Mobs.\*

## What determines the level of the Elite Mob?

Item tier + Guild tier + Party hunting bonus (applied when a player is near other players) \* 10. What determines a player's item tier?

Material tier + main enchantment level + elite main enchantment level Keep in mind that the item tier for spawning is the average of the item tier for all armor items plus the best weapon in the hotbar. Additionally, secondary enchantments help in dealing more damage but will not increase the item tier.

## Material tiers

Trident material: Tier 9 Netherite material: Tier 8 Diamond material: Tier 7 Iron material: Tier 6 Stone / Chain material: Tier 5 Gold / Wood / Leather material: Tier 3 Main enchantments:

Swords, axes, tridents, hoes (if enabled): Sharpness Any armor: Protection Bows: Power Item example:

Diamond sword with sharpness 5 and elite sharpness 2:

10 (material tier) + 5 (main enchantment) + 2 (elite main enchantment) = tier 17 item&#x20;

## What kind of rewards can I get from Elite Mobs?

Before talking about the special rewards, it's important to note that only naturally spawned Elite Mobs will drop special loot. You can not use mob spawners to get special loot. Additionally, the anticheat mechanisms may remove an Elite Mob's eligibility to drop special loot. This means that if the system detects that you are fighting an Elite Mob which is trapped or which can't reach you for some reason (you're flying / on a tower / it's in a hole) it will cease to show its power trail and will no longer drop any special loot. Additionally, they drop more vanilla loot than regular mobs. The drop chance is not 100%, but the odds of getting loot increase with the mob level.
